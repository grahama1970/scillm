## Summary

This PR adds conditional authorization header formatting to support Ollama Turbo (ollama.com), which requires a different authentication format than self-hosted Ollama instances.

- When api_base starts with 'https://ollama.com', use raw API key without 'Bearer' prefix
- For all other URLs, use standard 'Bearer {api_key}' format
- Updated auth headers in chat completion, text completion, and embeddings
- Added tests to verify the authorization header behavior

This change enables LiteLLM to work with Ollama Turbo (ollama.com) which requires a different authentication format than self-hosted Ollama instances.
