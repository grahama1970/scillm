You are reviewing this LiteLLM fork for readiness to merge the `feat/final-polish` branch back into `main`.

Goals
- Assess deploy readiness based on deterministic tests, readiness gates, and provider shims.
- Identify merge blockers, risky changes, and missing docs/tests.
- Recommend concrete next steps to get to green.

Deliverable (use this exact structure)
- Summary (2â€“3 bullets)
- Merge Blockers
- High-Risk Areas
- Readiness (Dev vs. Strict/Live)
- CI/Docs Gaps
- Action Plan (ordered, small steps)

Context
- Prefer accurate, actionable, and concise findings over verbosity.
- Assume CI will run `make project-ready` and `make project-ready-live` with `READINESS_EXPECT=ollama,codex-agent` when providers are available.
- Consider the codex-agent mini-agent shim and provider env-gating.
