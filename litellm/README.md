<p align="center"><i>API‚Äëcompatible with LiteLLM.

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

```bash
# Bring up bridges + proxy + deps (from repo root)
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.scillm.stack.yml up --build -d

# Two live scenarios (skip‚Äëfriendly)
python ../scenarios/codeworld_judge_live.py

## Why SciLLM

SciLLM targets practitioners who need reproducible, inspectable end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflows that combine LLMs with verifiable computation.

- Who it‚Äôs for
  - Scientists/engineers building proof‚Äëof‚Äëconcepts around formal verification (Lean4 today), algorithm selection, and agent tool‚Äëuse loops.
  - Teams who want OpenAI‚Äëcompatible ergonomics, local‚Äëfirst bring‚Äëup (Docker), and ‚Äúone way to green‚Äù readiness gates.
  - Educators/tinkerers who want runnable scenarios and artifacts they can inspect.

- What you get
  - Any LLM model LiteLLM supports (local or cloud) behind the same OpenAI‚Äëstyle surface.
  - Certainly (Lean4 umbrella, beta): convert natural‚Äëlanguage + structured requirements to Lean4, return proofs or structured guidance/diagnostics.
  - CodeWorld: run multiple concurrent strategies safely; add dynamic scoring; judge/rank winners.
  - codex‚Äëagent: code‚Äëcentric agent surface; run multi‚Äëiteration plans and call MCP tools via your sidecar.
  - mini‚Äëagent: tiny deterministic agent for quick tool‚Äëuse experiments.
  - Reproducibility by design: per‚Äërun artifacts (run_id, request_id, item_ids, session/track) and strict readiness gates.

## Modules at a Glance

| Module | What it is | When to use | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Certainly (Lean4 umbrella) | Prover bridge under a stable provider alias | Batch‚Äëcheck obligations/lemmas; keep client code stable while swapping backends | Router posts `{messages, items, options}` to Lean4 bridge; returns `summary + results + run_manifest` with diagnostics |
| CodeWorld | Strategy orchestrator with dynamic judge | Compare multiple algorithms on the same inputs; evaluate under your metrics; rank winners | Execute strategies with RLIMITs; optional no‚Äënet; dynamic Python `score()`; built‚Äëin weighted/lex judge |
| mini‚Äëagent | Tiny agent loop for tool‚Äëuse | Local, deterministic experiments with Python/Rust/Go/JS tools | In‚Äëprocess shim or Docker tools sidecar; emits parsed tool calls and metrics |
| codex‚Äëagent | Code‚Äëoriented agent provider | Sidecar/HTTP codex flows exposed via LiteLLM | Env‚Äëgated provider; OpenAI‚Äëcompatible; integrates via Router |

## Real‚ÄëWorld Scenarios

- Multi‚Äëheuristic selection (CodeWorld): package DP/heuristics as variants; run both; supply a domain‚Äëspecific `score()`; judge with correctness/speed/brevity; keep winner + provenance.
- Spec compliance verification (Certainly): send `messages + lean4_requirements` (or canonical `items`); get proof results with stable item_ids and diagnostics; rerun with the same manifest.
- Inner‚Äëloop bug fix (mini‚Äëagent): run tool invocations deterministically; capture final answer + telemetry.
- Code refactor planning (codex‚Äëagent): code‚Äëcentric agent via OpenAI‚Äëcompatible provider; health‚Äëcheckable sidecar.

See <a href="../QUICK_START.md">QUICK_START.md</a> for runnable commands.

## Installation and Compatibility

- pip install: `pip install litellm` (SciLLM remains API‚Äëcompatible with LiteLLM)
- Env flags (preferred): `SCILLM_ENABLE_*` (aliases supported: `LITELLM_ENABLE_*`)
- CLI aliases: `scillm`, `scillm-proxy` (mirrors LiteLLM commands)
- Deployment: `deploy/docker/compose.scillm.stack.yml` provides bridges + local tooling

## Quick Start

## Strategy Search: MCTS (Experimental)

Add decision-time stochastic search for CodeWorld variants.

- Enable (bridge side): `CODEWORLD_ENABLE_MCTS=1` (default)
- Deterministic runs: set `SCILLM_DETERMINISTIC_SEED=42`
- Example:

```bash
CODEWORLD_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8887 python ../scenarios/mcts_codeworld_demo.py
```

Response extras:
- `results[i].mcts`: `{best_variant, best_value, visits, explored, rollouts, depth, uct_c, seed}`
- `run_manifest.mcts_stats`: summary at the run level

Security posture: Phase‚Äë1 MCTS uses a hash‚Äëbased pseudo value for rollouts (no extra code execution) to avoid expanding the attack surface. Future extensions may enable partial evaluation per rollout behind a separate flag.
