<p align="center"><i>API‑compatible with LiteLLM. Adds optional modules for: (1) formal methods via a prover bridge (“Certainly”, Lean4 in beta), (2) code strategy orchestration with dynamic scoring (“CodeWorld”), and (3) small live agent flows (mini‑agent, codex‑agent). See the root <a href="../QUICK_START.md">QUICK_START.md</a> and scenarios/ for runnable demos. Enable with SCILLM_ENABLE_* or LITELLM_ENABLE_*.</i></p>

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

```bash
# Bring up bridges + proxy + deps (from repo root)
docker compose -f deploy/docker/compose.scillm.stack.yml up --build -d

# Two live scenarios (skip‑friendly)
python ../scenarios/codeworld_judge_live.py
LITELLM_ENABLE_CERTAINLY=1 CERTAINLY_BRIDGE_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
  python ../scenarios/certainly_router_release.py

## Why SciLLM

SciLLM targets practitioners who need reproducible, inspectable end‑to‑end workflows that combine LLMs with verifiable computation.

- Who it’s for
  - Scientists/engineers building proof‑of‑concepts around formal verification (Lean4 today), algorithm selection, and agent tool‑use loops.
  - Teams who want OpenAI‑compatible ergonomics, local‑first bring‑up (Docker), and “one way to green” readiness gates.
  - Educators/tinkerers who want runnable scenarios and artifacts they can inspect.

- What you get
  - Any LLM model LiteLLM supports (local or cloud) behind the same OpenAI‑style surface.
  - Certainly (Lean4 umbrella, beta): convert natural‑language + structured requirements to Lean4, return proofs or structured guidance/diagnostics.
  - CodeWorld: run multiple concurrent strategies safely; add dynamic scoring; judge/rank winners.
  - codex‑agent: code‑centric agent surface; run multi‑iteration plans and call MCP tools via your sidecar.
  - mini‑agent: tiny deterministic agent for quick tool‑use experiments.
  - Reproducibility by design: per‑run artifacts (run_id, request_id, item_ids, session/track) and strict readiness gates.

## Modules at a Glance

| Module | What it is | When to use | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Certainly (Lean4 umbrella) | Prover bridge under a stable provider alias | Batch‑check obligations/lemmas; keep client code stable while swapping backends | Router posts `{messages, items, options}` to Lean4 bridge; returns `summary + results + run_manifest` with diagnostics |
| CodeWorld | Strategy orchestrator with dynamic judge | Compare multiple algorithms on the same inputs; evaluate under your metrics; rank winners | Execute strategies with RLIMITs; optional no‑net; dynamic Python `score()`; built‑in weighted/lex judge |
| mini‑agent | Tiny agent loop for tool‑use | Local, deterministic experiments with Python/Rust/Go/JS tools | In‑process shim or Docker tools sidecar; emits parsed tool calls and metrics |
| codex‑agent | Code‑oriented agent provider | Sidecar/HTTP codex flows exposed via LiteLLM | Env‑gated provider; OpenAI‑compatible; integrates via Router |

---

## Real‑World Scenarios

- Multi‑heuristic selection (CodeWorld): package DP/heuristics as variants; run both; supply a domain‑specific `score()`; judge with correctness/speed/brevity; keep winner + provenance.
- Spec compliance verification (Certainly): send `messages + lean4_requirements` (or canonical `items`); get proof results with stable item_ids and diagnostics; rerun with the same manifest.
- Inner‑loop bug fix (mini‑agent): run tool invocations deterministically; capture final answer + telemetry.
- Code refactor planning (codex‑agent): code‑centric agent via OpenAI‑compatible provider; health‑checkable sidecar.

See <a href="../QUICK_START.md">QUICK_START.md</a> for runnable commands.

## Installation and Compatibility

- pip install: `pip install litellm` (SciLLM remains API‑compatible with LiteLLM)
- Env flags (preferred): `SCILLM_ENABLE_*` (aliases supported: `LITELLM_ENABLE_*`)
- CLI aliases: `scillm`, `scillm-proxy` (mirrors LiteLLM commands)
- Deployment: `deploy/docker/compose.scillm.stack.yml` provides bridges + local tooling
